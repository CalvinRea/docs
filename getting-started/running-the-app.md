# ðŸš€ Running the Application

Once you have completed the [Setup Instructions](/getting-started/setup), you can start the CICADA application in development mode.

Open your terminal in the project's root directory (`CICADA-main/`) and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will:
1.  Start the Vite development server.
2.  Compile the React application.
3.  Make the application available in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite will show the exact URL in the terminal).

The development server supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so changes you make to the source code will be reflected in the browser automatically without a full page reload.

**Accessing the Application:**
-   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
-   You should see the CICADA homepage.

**Development Mode Build:**
If you need to create a development build (e.g., for testing specific build outputs without full optimization), you can use:
```bash
npm run build:dev
```
This will build the application in development mode and place the output in the `dist` folder.
```

# ðŸ“¦ Production Build

When you are ready to deploy CICADA to a production environment, you need to create an optimized build of the application.

To create a production build, run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will:
1.  Use Vite to compile and bundle your React application.
2.  Optimize the assets (JavaScript, CSS, images) for performance.
3.  Minify the code.
4.  Generate static files in the `dist/` directory.

The contents of the `dist/` folder are what you will deploy to your static hosting provider (e.g., Azure Static Web Apps, Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3).

**After Building:**
-   The `dist/` directory will contain an `index.html` file and subdirectories for assets (like `assets/`).
-   Ensure your hosting provider is configured to serve `index.html` for all client-side routes.
